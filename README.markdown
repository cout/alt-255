Alt-255: An irc bot in ruby
===========================


Alt-255 is an old bot I wrote when I was learning ruby.  I am now
publishing the source code in git.

Unfortunately a hard drive crash has left me with an older version of
the bot.  At one point in time it had a complete plugin system and an
ircII-style interface.  I may try to resurrect these features, but
likely not.
