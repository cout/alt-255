sequence gambit-|In an expression, the value of an object may be modified at most once. The only exceptions to this are the following "intermediate sequence points": || && ?: , and immediately before a function call. Thus, in practice in an expression only one access to an object may be to modify its value. All others must be for computing the value only, and they should be demonstrably before the modification. -  c.faq  3.1-3.8
