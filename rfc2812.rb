    RPL_WELCOME = 001

    RPL_MYINFO = 004
#               "<servername> <version> <available user modes>
# <available channel modes>"
# 
#          - The server sends Replies 001 to 004 to a user upon
#            successful registration.
# 
    RPL_BOUNCE = 005
#               "Try server <server name>, port <port number>"
# 
#          - Sent by the server to a user to suggest an alternative
#            server.  This is often used when the connection is
#            refused because the server is already full.
# 
    RPL_USERHOST = 302
#               ":*1<reply> *( " " <reply> )"
# 
#          - Reply format used by USERHOST to list replies to
#            the query list.  The reply string is composed as
#            follows:
# 
#            reply = nickname [ "*" ] "=" ( "+" / "-" ) hostname
# 
#            The '*' indicates whether the client has registered
#            as an Operator.  The '-' or '+' characters represent
#            whether the client has set an AWAY message or not
#            respectively.
# 
    RPL_ISON = 303
#               ":*1<nick> *( " " <nick> )"
# 
#          - Reply format used by ISON to list replies to the

    RPL_NOWAWAY = 306
#               ":You have been marked as being away"
# 
#          - These replies are used with the AWAY command (if
#            allowed).  RPL_AWAY is sent to any client sending a
#            PRIVMSG to a client which is away.  RPL_AWAY is only
#            sent by the server to which the client is connected.
#            Replies RPL_UNAWAY and RPL_NOWAWAY are sent when the
#            client removes and sets an AWAY message.

#               "<nick> :*( ( "@" / "+" ) <channel> " " )"
# 
#          - Replies 311 - 313, 317 - 319 are all replies
#            generated in response to a WHOIS message.  Given that
#            there are enough parameters present, the answering
#            server MUST either formulate a reply out of the above
#            numerics (if the query nick is found) or return an
#            error reply.  The '*' in RPL_WHOISUSER is there as
#            the literal character and not as a wild card.  For
#            each reply set, only RPL_WHOISCHANNELS may appear
#            more than once (for long lists of channel names).
#            The '@' and '+' characters next to the channel name
#            indicate whether a client is a channel operator or
#            has been granted permission to speak on a moderated
#            channel.  The RPL_ENDOFWHOIS reply is used to mark
#            the end of processing a WHOIS message.

#               "<nick> :End of WHOWAS"
# 
#          - When replying to a WHOWAS message, a server MUST use
#            the replies RPL_WHOWASUSER, RPL_WHOISSERVER or
#            ERR_WASNOSUCHNICK for each nickname in the presented
#            list.  At the end of all reply batches, there MUST
#            be RPL_ENDOFWHOWAS (even if there was only one reply
#            and it was an error).
#

# 
#          - Replies RPL_LIST, RPL_LISTEND mark the actual replies
#            with data and end of the server's response to a LIST
#            command.  If there are no channels available to return,
#            only the end reply MUST be sent.

    RPL_TOPIC = 332
#               "<channel> :<topic>"
# 
#          - When sending a TOPIC message to determine the
#            channel topic, one of two replies is sent.  If
#            the topic is set, RPL_TOPIC is sent back else
#            RPL_NOTOPIC.
# 
    RPL_INVITING = 341
#               "<channel> <nick>"
# 
#          - Returned by the server to indicate that the

#            being passed onto the end client.

    RPL_ENDOFINVITELIST = 347
#               "<channel> :End of channel invite list"
# 
#          - When listing the 'invitations masks' for a given channel,
#            a server is required to send the list back using the
#            RPL_INVITELIST and RPL_ENDOFINVITELIST messages.  A
#            separate RPL_INVITELIST is sent for each active mask.
#            After the masks have been listed (or if none present) a
#            RPL_ENDOFINVITELIST MUST be sent.
# 
    RPL_EXCEPTLIST = 348
#               "<channel> <exceptionmask>"
    RPL_ENDOFEXCEPTLIST = 349
#               "<channel> :End of channel exception list"
# 
#          - When listing the 'exception masks' for a given channel,
#            a server is required to send the list back using the
#            RPL_EXCEPTLIST and RPL_ENDOFEXCEPTLIST messages.  A

#            The <version> is the version of the software being
#            used (including any patchlevel revisions) and the
#            <debuglevel> is used to indicate if the server is
#            running in "debug mode".
# 
#            The "comments" field may contain any comments about
#            the version or further version details.
# 
    RPL_WHOREPLY = 352
#               "<channel> <user> <host> <server> <nick>
# ( "H" / "G" > ["*"] [ ( "@" / "+" ) ]

# 
    RPL_ENDOFWHO = 315
#               "<name> :End of WHO list"
# 
#          - The RPL_WHOREPLY and RPL_ENDOFWHO pair are used
#            to answer a WHO message.  The RPL_WHOREPLY is only
#            sent if there is an appropriate match to the WHO
#            query.  If there is a list of parameters supplied
#            with a WHO message, a RPL_ENDOFWHO MUST be sent
#            after processing each list item with <name> being
#            the item.
# 
    RPL_NAMREPLY = 353
#               "( "=" / "*" / "@" ) <channel>
# :[ "@" / "+" ] <nick> *( " " [ "@" / "+" ] <nick> )
#          - "@" is used for secret channels, "*" for private
#            channels, and "=" for others (public channels).
# 
    RPL_ENDOFNAMES = 366
#               "<channel> :End of NAMES list"
# 
#          - To reply to a NAMES message, a reply pair consisting
#            of RPL_NAMREPLY and RPL_ENDOFNAMES is sent by the
#            server back to the client.  If there is no channel
#            found as in the query, then only RPL_ENDOFNAMES is
# 
#            returned.  The exception to this is when a NAMES
#            message is sent with no parameters and all visible
#            channels and contents are sent back in a series of
#            RPL_NAMEREPLY messages with a RPL_ENDOFNAMES to mark
#            the end.
# 
    RPL_LINKS = 364

#            a server is required to send the list back using the
#            RPL_BANLIST and RPL_ENDOFBANLIST messages.  A separate
#            RPL_BANLIST is sent for each active banmask.  After the
#            banmasks have been listed (or if none present) a
#            RPL_ENDOFBANLIST MUST be sent.
# 
    RPL_INFO = 371

    RPL_ENDOFINFO = 374
#               ":End of INFO list"

#               ":- <text>"
    RPL_ENDOFMOTD = 376
#               ":End of MOTD command"
# 
#          - When responding to the MOTD message and the MOTD file
#            is found, the file is displayed line by line, with
#            each line no longer than 80 characters, using
# 
#            RPL_MOTD format replies.  These MUST be surrounded
#            by a RPL_MOTDSTART (before the RPL_MOTDs) and an
#            RPL_ENDOFMOTD (after).
# 
    RPL_YOUREOPER = 381
#               ":You are now an IRC operator"

#            the operator.
# 
    RPL_YOURESERVICE = 383
#               "You are service <servicename>"

#               "<server> :<string showing server's local time>"
# 
#          - When replying to the TIME message, a server MUST send
#            the reply using the RPL_TIME format above.  The string
#            showing the time need only contain the correct day and
#            time there.  There is no further requirement for the
#            time string.

#            replies RPL_USERSTART, RPL_USERS, RPL_ENDOFUSERS and
#            RPL_NOUSERS are used.  RPL_USERSSTART MUST be sent
#            first, following by either a sequence of RPL_USERS
#            or a single RPL_NOUSER.  Following this is
#            RPL_ENDOFUSERS.

# 
#          - The RPL_TRACE* are all returned by the server in
#            response to the TRACE message.  How many are
#            returned is dependent on the TRACE message and
#            whether it was sent by an operator or not.  There
#            is no predefined order for which occurs first.
#            Replies RPL_TRACEUNKNOWN, RPL_TRACECONNECTING and

#            process of completing the 'server handshake'.
#            RPL_TRACELINK is sent by any server which handles
#            a TRACE message and has to pass it on to another

#            response to a TRACE command traversing the IRC
#            network should reflect the actual connectivity of
#            the servers themselves along that path.
# 
#            RPL_TRACENEWTYPE is to be used for any connection
#            which does not fit in the other categories but is
#            being displayed anyway.
